fastcraft
intention:
make a new world with dungeons set to 100
all spawn rates on ores x2 except for diamond which is x5
use bonus chests

what is in here is modified loot tables
almost all drops from mobs are doubled. all percent chance drops are doubled (2.5% chance has been increased to 5% chance)
bonus chests have two spawn villager eggs in them

put the loot table in \.minecraft\saves\WORLDNAME\data\loot_tables

if someone else is joining in, to give them a bonus chest use the following command
/give PLAYER chest 1 0 {BlockEntityTag:{LootTable:"minecraft:chests/spawn_bonus_chest"}}
